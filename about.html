                <p class="">Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas
                in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by
                trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become
                easier and more accessible. Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the
                New World from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st
                century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.
                
                Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. The
                wholesale sector depended on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing
                often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks)
                and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies
                ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.Pilgrimages were common in both the European and
                Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally.
                
                In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to
                significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and
                included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the
                end of the Grand Tour.
                
                Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of
                railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people
                began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like
                Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over
                much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was
                a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis
                Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21</p>
